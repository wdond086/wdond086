- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my problem-solving skills as a developer by getting a detailed understanding of key concepts in Software engineering. I am doing so by following a roadmaps I found online. You can track my progress on the roadmap here:

[![roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/card/tall/675afdf5ecc889bb0d37b524?variant=dark)](https://roadmap.sh)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang and Rust, and re-learning Data Structures and Algorithms using those languages. Why Go? It's close to Python syntactically while being more performant. Why Rust? I like its approach to handling memory safety with the concept of borrowing, and it's a low-level language which I think is essential for any engineer to know at least one of.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cool Golang/Rust-based projects aiming to solve real problems.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with networking and making connections with experts in the field.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Software engineering, mechanical engineering, soccer, and music.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tdondjiwilfried@hotmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering as well.
